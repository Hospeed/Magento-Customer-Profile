*We're currently splitting the Pulse Storm repository into individual extension repositories.  Please excuse out mess while this is sorted*

###Build Instructions

The `build_customer_page.bash` file is a bash script that will create a simple tar archive of the extension files. 

    $ ./build_customer_page.bash
    
This script assumes the existence of a `var` folder.
